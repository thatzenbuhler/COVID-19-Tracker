# COVID-19 Tracker

This is a simple WebView app created in Flutter for the purpose of easily displaying
up-to-date data from Johns Hopkins University on the ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic.

It is a one-page application with one 'home button' for navigating back to the initial
URL if the user clicks links and wants to return to the main website.
